# Android-app-data-storage-using-amazon-ec2-instance
Client side API to communicate with my AWS HTTPServer. 


This is the client side API for my HTTP server hosted at amazon ec2 instance. I used this to store images in Bitmap, data in JSON
and user authentication info

I can further extend the service by using a NOSQL db instead and allowing storage in any format
